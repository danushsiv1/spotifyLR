# Spotify Playlist Analyzer

This project analyzes the characteristics of Spotify playlists and provides insights such as the mood, energy level, and tempo of the tracks within the playlist. Users can input a Spotify playlist URL, and the application will fetch data using the Spotify API and display a summary of the playlist's features.

## Features
- Fetch a playlist by URL.
- Analyze the playlist's characteristics, such as:
  - Average mood (happy, sad, energetic, etc.)
  - Average tempo, energy, and danceability.
- Suggest complementary songs based on the playlist's features.

## Technologies Used
- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- Python
  - `requests` for interacting with the Spotify API
  - `Flask` for the web application (if applicable)
  - `pandas` for data analysis
  - `matplotlib`/`Plotly` for visualizations (if applicable)
